# audio-licensing-Wordpress-plugin
A better and more comprehensive solution to audio media sales and licensing where Sell Media fails to support or include fully functional commits to audio oriented modules.

This is an initial commit that will be updated as time permits with will be made available in the Wordpress plug-in repository in a version 1.0 release. More information regarding this project will be made available.

BACKGROUND
Increasingly there is a need in the ever changing landscape for Wordpress plugins that are not solely players or for digital downloading for individual sale. This project seek to remedy a solution for selling and licensing audio as an intellectual property to visual media clients. It would allow for inline listening via HTML5 with flash fallback of audio on the node as well as in the cart.
